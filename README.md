LaunchCodes is a powerful audio plugin built for synthesizing explosive sounds, outfitted with oscillator and noise synth sources, a rack of re-orderable effects, two LFOs capable of modulating almost any parameter, and over 20 unique custom-designed GUI components. It's my first project released under the name **Armory** and alone has been a five-month effort from beginning to its initial release, all built in Juce.
